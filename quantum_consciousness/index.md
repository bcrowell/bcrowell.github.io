The junk science of quantum consciousness
=========================================

Wikipedia defines [quantum woo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mysticism) as a pejorative term for "a set of
metaphysical beliefs and associated practices that seek to relate
consciousness, intelligence, spirituality, or mystical worldviews to
the ideas of quantum mechanics and its interpretations." It has a long
history

A weird phenomenon in the physical sciences is when the aging lions of the field
veer into areas outside their competence and start making silly claims.
