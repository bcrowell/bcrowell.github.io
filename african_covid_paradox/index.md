The African COVID paradox
===================================================

How would you like some good news about COVID, which is also good news about Africa?

The map shows the current best estimates, country by country, of the number of people who
have died of COVID. If you're like me, you know people who have died during the epidemic,
and with elderly people, at least in some cases, it can be hard to know whether COVID was really the reason they died or if it was just
a contributing cause or not the cause at all. And in many poor countries, there aren't
detailed and systematic death records. This map, made as an open-source project by *The Economist*,
sidesteps those issues by looking at the total number of deaths during the epidemic, and subtracting
the baseline of deaths that would have been expected based on data from before COVID hit.

The good news is that equatorial Africa has extremely low death rates from this virus.
The most extreme case is Sierra Leone, which is the little gray oval on the west coast
of Africa. You might think that the gray color was like the gray color of Greenland, a
blank marker to show that there's no data. No, it's real. The COVID death rate there seems
to be really, really low.

That's good, but totally unexpected. For comparison, here's a map from before COVID of how badly different
regions of the world are afflicted with lower respiratory tract infections. The colors represent something
called a "disability-adjusted life year" (DALY), which is a way of measuring how many years of life people missed
out on because they died, or an attempt to assign an equivalent if the disease didn't kill them but hurt their
quality of life. Check out the scale. Sierra Leone's suffering from these infections is more than *70 times*
what we experience where I live, in the US. This is partly because it's a poor country with a weak public
health system, and also partly because they experience more conditions such as malnutrition and poor housing,
which worsen people's health outcomes.
