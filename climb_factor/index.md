What's the climb factor of your run?
====================================

I love mountain trail running because it's simple and elemental. I don't need fancy gear,
and I'm directly tuned in to the natural world. Plus, how else are you going to get your
feet this dirty?

But there are good reasons to geek out about this sport when you're at home
on the couch. Here's a map of one of my favorite summer trail runs in the San
Jacinto Mountains. (If you want to see an actual usable map and description,
there's one [here on trailrunproject](https://www.trailrunproject.com/trail/7093426/san-jacinto-peak-loop).)
When I first envisioned this loop, I wasn't sure it was within my ability to do
safely by myself. It's not hard to work out the total mileage, and since the map
is a topo, you can also figure out how much elevation gain there is. Those are the two
numbers that people have traditionally looked at simply because they were easy to
get off of a paper map, and if you're curious what they are for this run, you can
seem them on the trailrunproject page, where they've been calculated by a computer.

The problem is that those numbers don't really tell you very much. The
total distance is helpful, but the science shows us that total
elevation gain isn't really a useful measure of energy
expenditure. It's a natural thing that laypeople wonder about. For
example, a reader of The Guardian [wrote in](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/07/readers-reply-is-running-up-and-down-a-hill-better-for-you-than-running-on-the-flat) to the "Notes and Queries"
column to ask, "Is running up and down a hill better for you than
running on the flat? Or does the downhill bit being easier counteract
the uphill bit? What about running down a hill and then up, when
youâ€™re already tired?" Well, the part about "better for you" is something
I don't really care about, because I run for enjoyment, but anyway the
underlying question is basically one about energy costs, which is the
same one I need to know about for my purposes, in gauging whether my
endurance will be sufficient to get back to town.

I've written a [scientific paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.03.438339v2) on this topic,
which may not be as entertaining as some of the cheeky British humor in the
Guardian column.
