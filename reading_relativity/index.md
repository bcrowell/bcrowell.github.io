Reading relativity
==================

Recommended reading (mostly free) about Einstein's universe, for people with a variety of math backgrounds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Online, I run into a lot of laypeople who are curious about black holes or the big bang, as well
as people with more of a background in philosophy, engineering, or one of the sciences.
Often they have great questions, but are not looking in the right places to get
clear, reliable information. Laypeople are often reading magazine or newspaper popularizations,
or watching videos, and many of those treatments are inaccurate. People with more of a STEM background may be looking at presentations that
are old-fashioned or that make the subject look more mysterious than it is. This blog post is my
attempt to provide a reader's guide to relativity, with options that allow you to decide how
much you want to try to digest at once, and at what math level. Because I love free information,
I've tried to list mostly free articles and books, but when there's a non-free book that I
think is outstanding, I've included it. Some of the links are to materials written by me (Ben Crowell). The
list is broken down into headings by general topic, and then each heading lists resources
at different mathematical levels.

# Spacetime diagrams, relativity of time, the light cone

This is a topic that is inherently pretty easy to discuss without a lot of math. The resources below are all ones that use only easy math.

# The metric

## With easy math

* [Why can't you go faster than the speed of light? -- An explanation without equations or fallacies.](../faster_than_light) (Crowell) - As suggested by the title, the emphasis in this short article is on explaining why superluminal speeds are impossible, but I accomplish that by developing from scratch, in a visual style, the relevant facts about the metric. (20 min)

## Graduate level

* Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity (Carroll) - As far as I know, this is the best option right now at the graduate level, since the old standards (MTW and Geroch) are 40 years out of date. There is an earlier, shorter version that is [available for free on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9712019).
