Reviews of videos showing what it's like to fall into a black hole
==================================================================

In 2018-2019, I spent a couple of months worth of my free time writing
[open-source software](https://github.com/bcrowell/karl)
to simulate what an observer sees as they're falling into a black hole.
It was a lot of fun. I learned some physics I hadn't known before.
(I have a PhD in physics, but my training was in experimental nuclear
physics, not general relativity.) When the software was done, I used it
to create a [video animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-H-PipYCKc), with
some very basic text explaining what was going on.

At that time, there were quite a few other pop-sci videos on youtube
on the same topic, but although some of them had much more elaborate
production values in terms of human entertainment (breathless narration,
animated human figures in spacesuits), the science was uniformly just awful.

Recently (November 2022), I took another look around on youtube, and I
found that although there is still a lot of awful dreck on the topic,
the situation has improved a lot. If you want to learn correct science
instead of misconceptions, and at the same time see something with
good production values and a good explanation of the physics, you have
some good options. Here are my reviews of several of these videos,
in order from best to worst. Strangely enough, youtube's search algorithms
decided to show me the very worst of these as its top-ranked choice --
I don't know if this is because it's paid advertising placement.

The best: ScienceClic, "What would we see if we fell into a Black Hole?"

This is a very nice and scientifically accurate video, much better than most of what one finds on youtube for this topic.
The quality of the explanation for laypeople is excellent. It refrains from
overblown "gee whiz" stuff, and it accurately describes the current state of
knowledge -- both what is known and what is uncertain.

My only scientific complaint has to do with the question of 


is that I think the discussion of seeing the whole future evolution of the outside universe is too dismissive and inappropriately mixes the rotating and nonrotating cases. The main body of the video is depicting an infall into Sag A*, with rotation. At the end, the scientific explanation correctly notes that there is a lot we actually don't understand about the rotating case. However, one of the things that is actually pretty uncertain, in the rotating case, is the question of whether you see the future of the universe. In models that have a bifurcate Cauchy horizon, this is actually what happens if you pass through the horizon that is topologically connected to the boundary at timelike infinity. Most likely you're destroyed by energetic processes at a mass inflation horizon, and therefore can't actually see the universe's whole future history, but this is not known for sure, and the all-of-history idea is not just a silly misconception based on neglecting the Doppler effect. This is one of the reasons why numerical simulations of the interior are so hard: you can't simulate the interior without simulating the entire future evolution of the exterior.
