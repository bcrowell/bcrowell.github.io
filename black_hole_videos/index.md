Reviews of videos showing what it's like to fall into a black hole
==================================================================

In 2018-2019, I spent a couple of months worth of my free time writing
[open-source software](https://github.com/bcrowell/karl)
to simulate what an observer sees as they're falling into a black hole.
It was a lot of fun. I learned some physics I hadn't known before.
(I have a PhD in physics, but my training was in experimental nuclear
physics, not general relativity.) When the software was done, I used it
to create a video animation, with
some very basic text explaining what was going on:

At that time, there were quite a few other pop-sci videos on youtube
on the same topic, but although some of them had much more elaborate
production values in terms of human entertainment (breathless narration,
animated human figures in spacesuits), the science was uniformly just awful.

Recently (November 2022), I took another look around on youtube, and I
found that although there is still a lot of awful dreck on the topic,
the situation has improved a lot. If you want to learn correct science
instead of misconceptions, and at the same time see something with
good production values and a good explanation of the physics, you have
some good options. Here are my reviews of several of these videos,
in order from best to worst. 

The best: "What would we see if we fell into a Black Hole?" (ScienceClic)

This is a very nice and scientifically accurate video, much better than most of what one finds on youtube for this topic.
The quality of the explanation for laypeople is excellent. It refrains from
overblown "gee whiz" stuff, and it accurately describes the current state of
knowledge -- both what is known and what is uncertain.

My only scientific complaint has to do with the question of whether an observer
falling into a black hole sees the entire future evolution of the outside universe
before they die. The answer is complicated and uncertain as of 2022, but the video
presents it as if the possibility was just a naive popular misconception based on
a lack of understanding of the basic physics. 
It's always been pretty clear that the see-forever idea does not apply to a non-spinning black
hole, but real-life black holes are all spinning, and for them the theoretical situation is not
really clear as of 2022. Physicists may want to read the more detailed discussion of this
at the end of this article.

Strangely enough, youtube's search algorithms
decided to show me this video as its top-ranked choice.
I don't know if that was because of some kind of paid advertising placement.
It's not the best of the lot scientifically, it doesn't have that many views, and the production values are not
that great. They seem to have copied snippets out of a lot of videos by other people, with only minimal
credit to them.

Most of the video is fairly accurate, but there are some mistakes.

The visuals mix realistic optical simulations with two-dimensional metaphors.

"...a region of spacetime so dense that even light cannot escape it."
The interior of an astrophysical black hole is hard vacuum.

"Recent gravitational-wave observations have shown that not all black holes are alike. Instead, the universe is littered with a vast zoo of different types of black holes, and a trip to each of them would be an entirely different experience."
The no-hair theorems tell us that this is not true, and nothing in gravitational wave observations has changed this picture. From context, it seems like you mean just that black holes come in radically different sizes, but that was known long before gravitational wave astronomy got going.

"So yes, you would be as dead hundreds of miles even before you hit the singularity [of a solar-mass black hole]."
This is a reasonable numerical estimate, but the narration makes it sound as if this is inside the horizon, when in fact it's outside the horizon.

The discussion of time dilation, Doppler shifts, and the spacelike nature of the singularity are all pretty good. (We don't actually know whether an astrophysical black hole has a spacelike singularity or a timelike one.)

"It might provide a route to a parallel universe or an opening to the throat of a wormhole."
This is not accurate for a black hole formed by gravitational collapse.




Discussion for physicists: Does an infalling observer see the entire future history of the outside universe?
---------------------------------------------------

My understanding of the
current state of knowledge on the see-forever issue is the
following. In models that have a bifurcate Cauchy horizon, the see-forever thing is
actually what happens if you pass through the horizon that is
topologically connected to the boundary at timelike infinity. Most
likely you're destroyed before that by energetic processes at a mass inflation
horizon, and therefore can't actually see the universe's whole future
history, but this is not known for sure, and the see-forever idea
is not just a silly misconception based on neglecting the Doppler
effect, as claimed by the ScienceClic narration. For an early presentation of this
idea, see Penrose, Battelle Rencontres: 1967 Lectures in Mathematics and Physics, p. 222.
Roger Penrose is not just some naive person who doesn't understand basic physics!

This is one of the reasons why numerical simulations of the
interior are so hard: you can't simulate the interior without
simulating the entire future evolution of the exterior. It's also
possible that Penrose's diverging blueshift is not actually present
in black holes that are formed by gravitational collapse.

Yes, it is possible that blueshift instability is just an artifact of
oversimplified models, but based on my limited understanding of the
currently literature, that is probably an outmoded attitude. Many
people, including me, used to feel very comfortable with the idea
that all black hole interiors had a Penrose diagram qualitatively
like that of region II of a Schwarzschild black hole. For this
type of causal diagram, it's immediately obvious that there is no
see-forever going on. The other, crazy stuff, we fervently hoped, was
only an artifact of the unphysical features of the Kerr spacetime,
which after all was never thought to be correct in detail as a model
of an astrophysical black hole. But that just doesn't seem to be
how things have turned out. [Recent work by Dafermos and coworkers](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~md384/research/structure-of-singularities/strong-cosmic-censorship.html) seems to make it more plausible that in classical GR there really is a Cauchy
horizon inside a spinning black hole formed by gravitational collapse.
That's way more scary and threatening than a tame little spacelike singularity!
