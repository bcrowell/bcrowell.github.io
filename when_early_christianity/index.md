The who, when, and where of early Christianity
==================

How little is known, and why it matters
---------------------------------------

In 1840, aliens landed in Iowa on the banks of the Cedar River and had
a series of enigmatic interactions with humans, spending only a short
time on our planet before suddenly and inexplicably leaving without a trace. The
people who met them were not literate white males, so it wasn't until
after the Civil War that anybody tried to write down a systematic account.

This is of course a fictional story, but it's a lot like the
historical puzzle of early Christianity. Newspaper reporters are
taught to nail down the who-what-where-when in the first paragraph. We
have very little of that for the period when the contours of the new
religion were being laid out, and it's the whens in particular that
are hard to pin down. The gospels (of which four were eventually chosen
to be canonical) are central to this story, but we don't have a single
firm date for any portion or version of them until about 155-157, which is when 
[Justin Martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Martyr) gives us our
first peek. That's a gap of well over a century.

The history matters if you care about how western civilization, for better or
for worse, had its collective brain molded. Were Christians persecuted, or
is that a myth? How much of Christianity is really the invention of the Apostle
Paul ("[Paulianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Christianity)"), and how much is due to people you've probably never heard
of, like [Marcion of Sinope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope)?
Can Paul's homophobia be surgically removed from the religion?
The Gospel of Mark presents Jesus's life with almost no mention of any
novel ethical teachings.[^novel_ethics] Did those ideas only later come to be associated with him?

The whos
--------

Probably the easiest of the "W's" is the whos.

The Gospel of Mark is likely the first written biographical material about Jesus, but
and it begins not with a description of Jesus but of John the Baptist.
John was a great celebrity of his time and place. He merits a long passage in
[Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus)
-- much longer than the brief mention of Jesus.[^josephus_on_jesus] A pagan writer like Epictetus, writing as late as
ca. 130 CE, demonstrates a clear consciousness of a baptism-based sect such as John's,
but no consciousness of Jesus or his sub-sect. During the first century CE, it's probably
most accurate to talk about something like a John-Jesus sect of Jews rather than any
exclusivist or distinctly recognized religion based on Jesus.

If anything, it was John who was more of a big deal to their contemporaries. Josephus, writing around 90 CE, says:

> Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army [ca. 36 CE, by the Nabateans] came
> from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against
> John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good
> man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to
> righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to
> come to baptism [...]

If Jesus had been more prominent, then it wouldn't have made much sense for people at the time to have
attributed these events to John's execution rather than Jesus's.

For the early leadership team, most
of us would think first of the apostles, but the existence of such a designated
group of twelve ([or 70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_disciples)) is unlikely to be historical, because
they don't line up at all with what we know from other sources about the movement's leadership.
Josephus mentions Jesus, John the Baptist, and Jesus's brother James, but none of the Twelve.
Peter is certain to have existed, since he is recorded as getting into very plausible
controversies with Paul. Included with Peter in these controversies were two other Jews, John the apostle and James the brother
of Jesus (not either of the apostles named James). These three are described by Paul as forming a core leadership
group (Gal 2:9). But Paul's extensive writings never mention the twelve except in one spot (1 Cor 15:5)
which is in the context of a creed. Because Paul deals so extensively with the real-world mechanics of
the early movement's politics and organization, it's impossible that he would omit any other mention
of the twelve if such a group was historical. When Paul does discuss which leaders were at a fifteen-day meeting in Jerusalem
(Galatians 1:18), the list is again the historically attested core group (himself, Peter, and James the brother of
Jesus).[^acts_on_twelve]

The four canonical gospels are all anonymous works.[^gospels_authorship]

Paul was the first of the prominent leaders of the Jesus movement to
be literate (Jesus probably wasn't[^jesus_literacy]), so we have a
fairly full picture of his life, including approximate dates. What is
odd is that we have no clear explanation for why, if Paulinism was
early, widespread, and popular, there is no more explicit or literal
record of Paul's wider influence for a century afterward.  Equally
mysterious is his later rehabilitation, a la Leon Trotsky. The record
is so sketchy that it's sort of like knowing that Trotsky was murdered
in Mexico City using an ice ax, but not knowing whether the killer was
FDR or Greta Garbo. All we get is an ultra-fragmented, distanced view
of some kind of inside-baseball sectarian conflict.

Notes
-----

[^novel_ethics]: Almost all the novel ethical material in the gospels is in the [Sermon on the Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount), which appears in the Gospel of Matthew, and also in a shorter version in Luke. This includes legalistic commandments (no lawsuits, no oaths), and emotional ones (peace, forgiveness, loving enemies, anger and lust as sins). Since Mark, which omits this, is earlier than Matthew and Luke, these teachings were either invented after Jesus's life or else reinserted after being mysteriously omitted from Mark.

[^josephus_on_jesus]: Antiquities of the Jews 20-9; excluding the likely forgery in 18-3

[^acts_on_twelve]: The Acts of the Apostles likewise focuses almost exclusively on Peter and Paul, mentioning the twelve only briefly. It's very telling that in a work with this title, there is essentially nothing that could be characterized as a historical representation of anything said or done by the twelve. (And Acts is in any case basically a work of historical fiction.) In Acts 1:11, an angel addresses the gathered twelve as ``you men of Galilee,'' which does line up with the likely historical reality that Jesus's most ardent followers during his own lifetime were all Galileans. The fact that there are no writings reliably attributed to any of the twelve also makes sense in terms of the historical reality that Jesus's followers would have been illiterate. (1 Peter and 2 Peter are pseudoepigraphical works by two different, later writers.)

[^gospels_authorship]: Re Luke and John, see the Wikipedia articles [Authorship of Lukeâ€“Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_Luke%E2%80%93Acts) and [Authorship of the Johannine works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_the_Johannine_works).

[^jesus_literacy]: Many experts believe that Jesus was unable to read.  Any opportunities to learn to read or write would have been extremely scarce, hence the disbelief expressed in Mark 6:2. The gospels say that Jesus did not have any formal opportunity to learn to read (John 7:15), and if this is true, then he could only have taught himself or learned informally from someone. (There were probably no institutions similar to our modern schools, and it's unclear whether Nazareth had a synagogue; if there was one, it probably didn't have a copy of the torah or other Hebrew scriptures.) From a straight reading of the gospels, we would get the impression that the adult Jesus had a deep knowledge of the scripture and was able to debate its fine points skillfully. But actually the passages in the gospels where he quotes scripture often show signs of being later layers added by Christian writers.
