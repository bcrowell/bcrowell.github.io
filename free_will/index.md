Physics didn't take away your free will, and quantum mechanics didn't give it back
==================

People who have thought hard about free will don't necessarily all agree on it.
The purpose of this piece isn't to convince you of one point of view or another
about free will in general, which wouldn't even be something that I had special expertise on.
I'm a physicist, and what I'm going to do is to present you with a menu of possible
points of view on free will, then explain why it is that, no matter which you choose,
the cold, impersonal laws of physics didn't take away your free will --
nor did quantum mechanics give it back by changing our ideas about randomness.
I've structured this like a series of freeway off-ramps. As soon as you find a
point of view on free will that seems reasonable to you, you can take the off-ramp
and I'll explain why I don't think the laws of physics are relevant for someone of
your persuasion.

Off-ramp number 1: The discussion is meaningless, because "free will" has never been defined satisfactorily.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you ask people for their opinions about free will (Clark 2019), you get all kinds of
answers. They contradict themselves.  They seem to engage in motivated reasoning. They may be sure that
they know what the phrase means, but they can't seem to define it in any way that withstands scrutiny. Religions
have their own doctrines about free will, such as the one in [Genesis 3:3](https://ebible.org/web/GEN03.htm) --
but rest assured that the answers supplied by the Abrahamic religions aren't the same as the ones you get from Buddhists.
Philosophers, at least up until fairly recently, didn't seem able to do any better.

One very reasonable point of view, then, is to say that if people want to talk about free will, the burden
is on them to provide a satisfactory definition. If they don't seem to have done so, then we should just
treat it by default as something that doesn't need to be discussed: it's a "pseudo-problem."
This is pretty reasonable, and in fact there was a time around 1920 when it was a very popular point of view
among the kind of people who published papers in philosophy journals.

Clearly if you take this off-ramp then
physics is irrelevant. Physics can't help us to solve a problem if we can't even pose the problem clearly.

Off-ramp number 2: compatibilism
--------------------------------

People mulled this over and published papers with titles like "The Pseudo-problem of Freedom of the Will"
(Schlick 1931) and "Is `Freewill' a Pseudo-Problem?" (Campbell 1951).
Then, surprisingly, there was
progress. The idea was to revive and clarify a point of view called [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism).
Compatibilists argue that that there are various situations in which we all agree, as a matter of common sense, that
a certain person lacks free will.

For example, someone with [obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder)
may compulsively wash their hands over and over again. They can't control their own behavior.
There are also lots of silly, fun examples, such as some of the robot parables in Stanislaw Lem's [The Cyberiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cyberiad) (one of my favorite science fiction books of all time).

Whether the examples are serious or silly, they can be interpreted in terms of a perfectly reasonable picture
of our world. We have a bunch of organs in our body. The liver has jobs like removing alcohol from the blood and
storing up energy. If your liver gets messed up, you can't function normally. Likewise your brain has jobs like
making decisions. If your brain gets messed up, you lose that ability.

OK, I know it's really, really silly to take surveys on intellectual questions, but just for the record, a
2020 [survey](https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/4838) showed that compatibilism was the preferred point of view of
about 60% out of several thousand English-speaking academic philosophers .

The reason compatibilism is called compatiblism is that it says there is no conflict between the fact that
the universe seems to have rules and the notion that your brain makes choices if it's in good working order.
So if you take the compatiblism off-ramp, then once again, the laws of physics don't say anything about whether
you do or don't have free will. The laws of physics help to explain why chemistry works the way it does, and
chemistry helps to explain why your brain works (or doesn't work) properly.
